## Dyanamic programming 
#### Kanpsack Problem :
   - Integer Knapsack
   - Integer Knapsack using recursion
   - Subset Sum
   - Minimum Subset Sum
   - Count Subset with given difference
   - Unbounded Knapsack
   - Unbounded Knapsack using recursion
   - Count Subset with given sum 
#### Longest common subsequence
*Subsequence can be discontinuous where Substring is continuous*
   - Length of Longest Common Subsequence
   - Length of Longest Common Substring
   - Print Longest Common Subsequence
   - Length of Shortest Common Supersequence
   - LCS TopdownApproach
   - LCS recursion memoization
   - Longest common subsequence recursion
   - Minimum no. of insertion and deletion to convert string s1 to s2.
   - Longest Palindromic Subsequence
   - Minimum no. of deletion in a string to make it palidrome.
   - Longest Repeating Subsequence.
   - Sequence Pattern matcing.
   - Minimum no. of insertion in a string to make it palidrome.
   - *Longest Palindromic Substring*
   - *Edit Distance : Minimum no. of insertion, deletion and Replacement to convert string s1 to s2.*
